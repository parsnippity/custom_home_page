# Custom Home Page

This project is a home page, such as the one in Chrome when you open a new tab, which can be easily customized to user preferences. The music video, profile picture, and website links can all be easily swapped out in the code to match user preferences.

I took inspiration from Google's new tab page, but I also added some things that page doesn't have. The assignment required a quote and a music player, so I envisioned those next to a profile picture. I also thought it would be nice to have a purple background, because it's a relatively calming color and one I think most people like. I ultimately didn't spend much time on the [design](https://www.figma.com/file/zHSkW4OHe3YYMYeatviKLB/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=Kjr6UF9GovalYYkq-1), because I immediately knew how I wanted it to look.

It was challenging styling the website links, because they kept doing everything but what I wanted them to do. I also had a bit of a challenge with the embedded YouTube video, because it's in an iframe copied and pasted from YouTube, so I didn't code it and I don't really feel comfortable messing with it, but I did have to style the video, and that proved troublesome for a time. However, I managed to figure it out and get everything looking just like I envisioned.
